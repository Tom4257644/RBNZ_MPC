<h1>Reserve Bank of New Zealand Montetary policy Challenge</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
I understand it is unusual to show high-school group projects, but as this was only 12 months ago and ~90% my work, I have included it. Montetary policy is something I am passionate about, regularly following Jarome Powell's activities in the US so doing this project was great fun for me, it was a shame we were capped at seven minutes, this presentation could have been an hour. 

We placed second nationally, a placing that is not normally recognised in this competition, but due to the fine margin, the judges made it known.

Attached is the full submission.
